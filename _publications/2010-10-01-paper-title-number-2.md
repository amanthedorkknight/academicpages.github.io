excerpt: 'Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), an allergen-mediated condition triggered by dietary components, is increasing in prevalence. The gold standard of EoE diagnosis currently involves quantification ofâ‰¥ 15 eosinophils (Eo)/High Power Field (HPF). Due to the patchy nature of the disease and unknown correlation of eosinophil (Eo) patterns with clinical phenotypes we aimed to automate Eo quantification across esophageal biopsies and assess possible correlations with esophageal biopsy locations and clinical phenotypes.'
