excerpt: 'Striking histopathological overlap between distinct but related conditions poses a significant disease diagnostic challenge. There is a major clinical need to develop computational methods enabling clinicians to translate heterogeneous biomedical images into accurate and quantitative diagnostics. This need is particularly salient with small bowel enteropathies; Environmental Enteropathy (EE) and Celiac Disease (CD). We built upon our preliminary analysis by developing an artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis platform utilizing deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for these enteropathies.'
